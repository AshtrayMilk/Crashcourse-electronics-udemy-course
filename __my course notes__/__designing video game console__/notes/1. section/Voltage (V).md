Voltage is really a manifestation of the electric field. It also can be thought as the difference of potential energy between two points inside the electric field. The bottom line is that an electric field can do work on a charge or moving a charge in an electric field takes work or uses energy.

Voltage is the potential energy per unit charge or mathematically:

### Equation: Definition of voltage
Given that a charge q0 is positioned in an electric field
Potential energy is referred to as U
V = U/q0

### Equation: Change in potential
V = dV = dU/q0

### Equation: Units of voltage
Since potential energy is a form of energy it is measured in joules, and the charge q0 is of course represented by coulumbs, therefore, 1 volt is defined as:
1 V = 1 J / 1 C
