 AC is simply a current or voltage that changes as a function
of time, and DC doesn’t. That’s all there is to it. However, working with AC and DC circuits are two completely different things since when current or voltage changes as a function of time it’s just one more variable or degree of freedom to deal with

### Direct current
 It simply means that the voltage and hence the current in a circuit is always flowing in the same direction. The current may fluctuate based on the power consumption of the circuit, but the main voltage supply stays constant at some value

DC sources are usually represented by the symbols of a DC voltage source along with a value and direction of current flow.  DC voltage source with have a variable next to it that is called the “controller”

### Alternating current
Alternating current or voltage means that the supply source is changing as a function of time.  There are a number of values that we can discuss when referring to AC signals; frequency, peak value, peak to peak value, and root-mean-square (RMS) value.
