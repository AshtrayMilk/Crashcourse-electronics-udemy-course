Ohms Law is a relationship between current, voltage, and resistance in a circuit element. If you know two of them, you can compute the third from Ohms law.

Ohms Law derived by Georg Simon Ohm in the 1800â€™s:
	-**Ohm's law** states that the [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") through a [conductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor "Electrical conductor") between two points is directly [proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics) "Proportionality (mathematics)") to the [voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage") across the two points.
