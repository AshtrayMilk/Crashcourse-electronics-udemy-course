Resistors
	-resist current flow, drop voltages

Capacitors
	-store electrical charge

Inductors/coils
	-store/transfer electromagnetic energy

Diodes
	-allow current to flow on one direction only
	-semiconductor

Transistor
	-used as amplifiers and switches
	-semiconductor

Batteries
	-source of electrical current

Wires
	-used as conducting wire, duh
