Power is the ability to “do work”. Power in the context of electronics means the amount of energy (w) absorbed or produced by an element as a function of time t.

### Equation: Definition of power
dw = V * dq/dt

This states that the change in energy (work) per unit time is equal to the voltage multiplied by the rate change of charge with respect to time. But, if you recall, dq/dt is equal to current i. 

Hence, dw can be written:

### Equation: Definition of power with voltage and current

dw = V * dq/dt = V * I = P


### Equation: Definition of power with ohms law

V=I*R
