Digital electronics are ultimately based on analog building blocks, but these building blocks have been encapsulated in chips (in most cases) and operate with only two states: HIGH (ON) and LOW (OFF)

After configuring the analog part of the digital systems, the actual building of these systems is quite easy
	-you can basically forget the electrical properties of circuits.

Examples:
	-computers
	-calculators
	-lcd watches
	-video game computers


Example of a digital signal, so called square wave
