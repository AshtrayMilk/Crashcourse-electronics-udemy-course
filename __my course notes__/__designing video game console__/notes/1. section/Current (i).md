The amount of charge q (electrons) that pass point p as a function of time
defines the current. Or mathematically, current is equal to the amount of charge per unit time:

 i = dq/dt
 (d = delta, change in unit)

## Conventional current / positive hole flow

Now, in general, we like to talk about conventional current or positive hole flow. So the convention is that when you see a current indicated in a circuit there is both an arrow showing its direction along with a value for the current with a sign. For example, Figure 1.10 depicts two currents that are exactly identical. In Figure 1.10a the current flows from left to right and has a value of 5 A, on the other hand, the current in Figure 1.10b is flowing in the opposite direction, but has a value of –5 A. Hence, the two currents are the same. 
	-Conventional current is thought as current flowing from the plusside to the negative side.
	-Even though electrons flow from negative side to towards the positive side
