When talking about power systems and AC, the peak and peak to peak values of the
voltage aren’t enough information since the shape of the wave form has a lot to do with the “average” voltage at any time. Hence, a value called the root-mean-square or RMS is used to refer to AC voltage in many cases

### Equation: Root-mean-square voltage
Vrms = 0.5*Vp-p / sqrt(2) = 0.5*Vp-p * .707

For example, the voltage supplied by your standard 120V 60Hz wall socket is really 120 V RMS.

What is the Vp-p value? To compute the Vp-p value, we can use the equation in reverse:

Given: Vrms = 0.5*Vp-p / sqrt(2)
Then: Vp-p = 2*Vrms * sqrt(2) = 2*120 * 1.414 = 339.4V

Additionally, if the sine wave is symmetrical, or in other words the magnitude of the positive peak is the same as the magnitude of the negative peak then both the positive and negative values Vpmax and Vpmin are the same (except for sign) and can be computed with the formula:

### Equation: Voltage peak value.
Vpmax|pmin = |0.5*Vp-p |

Which in this case equals 0.5*339.4V = 169.7V. Hence the positive peak Vpmax is 169.7V and the negative peak Vpmin is–169.7V.
