Photons can be thought of as particles just as electrons. If a photon of enough energy strikes an electron then the electron’s kinetic energy increases enough to cause it to jump out of orbit and onto the other plate causing a current flow.

This minimal energy is referred to as the work function or work energy
of the electron and usually is a few electron volts. Of course, different metals/materials have different work functions. Hence, you can design a photoelectric or solar cell based on this effect

It’s not the intensity of light, but the frequency of light that matters
